Developer Test for DotLabel Digital Creative Agency

PHP application for managing authorised hosts written using Laravel 4.3 MVC framework.

Application uses Sqlite as a SQL engine. Since this app is not likely to get more 
than 100,000 hits per day, it is a good and portable substitute to a full-blown RDBMS like Mysql.
Because all the data is stored in a normal file in the host's system, no separate process is needed
to get the data. This often makes it faster than the alternatives.
